# PrestaShop Dockerized Setup  

## Introduction  
PrestaShop is an open-source, feature-rich e-commerce platform designed to help businesses create and manage online stores. It offers a robust environment for creating dynamic, scalable, and customizable storefronts.  

This project involves setting up a PrestaShop application using Docker containers, with a MySQL database as its backend. The setup uses Docker Compose for simplified multi-container management.  

---

## Objectives  
- **Deploy PrestaShop**: Containerize and deploy PrestaShop for development and testing.  
- **Database Integration**: Use MySQL as a reliable and efficient backend for data storage.  
- **Automation**: Simplify setup and configuration through `docker-compose`.  
- **Database Management**: Manage and verify the database setup with the PrestaShop admin panel.  

---

## Prerequisites  
Ensure the following are installed:  
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  

---

## Setup Instructions  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
Clone the repository to your local system:  
bash  
git clone <repository-url>  
cd <repository-folder>  
  

### 2. Start the Application  
Use Docker Compose to bring up the services:  
bash  
docker-compose up -d  
  
This command initializes two services:  
- **MySQL**: A containerized MySQL database for PrestaShop.  
- **PrestaShop**: The main application, accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).  

### 3. Verify Running Containers  
Ensure the containers are running:  
bash  
docker ps  
  
You should see:  
- `prestashop_db`: The MySQL container.  
- `prestashop`: The PrestaShop application container.  

### 4. Access PrestaShop  
Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The PrestaShop platform will load automatically, using the configuration from your `docker-compose.yml` file.  

### 5. Stop and Remove Containers  
When done, stop and clean up the containers:  
bash  
docker-compose down

## Configuration Details  

### Docker Compose Overview  
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the setup:  
- **MySQL Service**:  
  - Image: `mysql:5.7`  
  - Data persists in the `db_data` volume.  
  - Credentials:  
    - Username: `root`  
    - Password: `admin`  
    - Database Name: `prestashop`  

- **PrestaShop Service**:  
  - Image: `prestashop/prestashop:latest`  
  - Runs on port `8080`.  
  - Automatically installs and connects to the database.  

### Key Environment Variables  

#### MySQL  
| Variable               | Description                             |  
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`  | Root password for MySQL (default: `admin`). |  
| `MYSQL_DATABASE`       | Name of the database for PrestaShop (default: `prestashop`). |  

#### PrestaShop  
| Variable           | Description                                    |  
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
| `DB_SERVER`        | Hostname of the MySQL container (`prestashop_db`). |  
| `DB_NAME`          | Database name for PrestaShop (`prestashop`).   |  
| `DB_USER`          | MySQL username (`root`).                      |  
| `DB_PASSWD`        | MySQL password (`admin`).                     |  
| `PS_INSTALL_AUTO`  | Automates PrestaShop installation (`1`).       |  
| `PS_DOMAIN`        | Domain for accessing PrestaShop (`localhost:8080`). |

## Features  

- **Easy Setup**: Docker Compose simplifies multi-container orchestration.  
- **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in Docker volumes (`db_data` and `prestashop_data`).  
- **Port Mapping**: Exposes PrestaShop on `localhost:8080` for easy access.  
- **Automation**: Environment variables handle PrestaShop and MySQL configuration.

## Future Improvements  
- **SSL Integration**: Secure the PrestaShop application with HTTPS.  
- **Database Backup**: Implement automated backup and restore functionality.  
- **Docker Compose Enhancements**: Add advanced scaling and multi-environment support.  
- **Monitoring**: Integrate tools to monitor application performance.

## Conclusion  
This project successfully demonstrates how to containerize and manage a PrestaShop application using Docker. By combining PrestaShop's powerful features with Docker's scalability and flexibility, the setup offers a robust environment for development and testing.
